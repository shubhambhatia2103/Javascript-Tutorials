# JavaScript Tutorials

Welcome to my repository where I document my journey from learning the basics to mastering JavaScript! ðŸš€


## Introduction

This repository serves as my personal learning journal as I progress through [Piyush Goyal's comprehensive JavaScript tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLinedj3B30sDFRdgPYvjnBs2JsDdHPIMv). Each file corresponds to a specific tutorial video from the playlist, with the file names structured numerically (01, 02, 03, etc.) to align with the tutorial sequence and my personal notes summarizing key concepts.
## How to Use

- Each JavaScript file is named according to the corresponding tutorial video from the playlist.
- Inside each file, you'll find the code demonstrated in the tutorial along with inline comments explaining key points.
- Additionally, I've included short key notes related to the topic within the code for quick reference.
